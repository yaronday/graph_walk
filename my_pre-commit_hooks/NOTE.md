The original .pre-commit-config.yaml has a full history git clone of prettier, ruff etc. 
Unfortunately a shallow clone is not supported, so I've decided to configure all locally.
These files are located at ~/my-hooks and configured at .pre-commit-config.yaml. 

ruff.toml resides at ~/.config/ruff.
